```
Title: Built a truly anonymous calling platform - no phone numbers, no accounts, no traces

Hey r/privacy,

After getting frustrated with "private" calling apps that still require phone numbers and store metadata, I built something different:

- Browser-based (no app = no permissions)
- No accounts or registration
- Pay per minute (no subscriptions tracking you)
- Rooms auto-expire leaving zero trace
- Open source SDK coming soon

It's called Liquid Calling. Would love feedback from this community on what else you'd want to see.

Not trying to shill, genuinely want input from privacy-focused users.
```

### r/cryptocurrency
```
Title: Phone calls, onchain - built anonymous calling that accepts USDC

Built browser-based calling that:
- Accepts USDC payment (Hyperliquid, Base, etc)
- No KYC or phone numbers
- Perfect for trading coordination
- Ephemeral rooms (auto-delete)

Traders can coordinate without doxxing. DAOs can have voice calls while staying anon.

liquidcalling.com if curious. Giving away minutes to early users.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Personalization is key** - Always mention something specific about them

3. **Keep it short** - Especially for DMs and first contact
4. **Be specific** - Mention exact use cases relevant to them
5. **Easy next step** - Include code/link for immediate action
6. **Follow up** - But max 2 times, then move on
7. **Track everything** - Data helps refine approach

## A/B Test Variables

Test different versions:
- Subject lines
- Free minutes amount (50 vs 100 vs 200)
- Emphasis (privacy vs convenience vs cost)
- CTA (try it vs demo vs free minutes)
- Length (ultra-short vs detailed)
- Tone (casual vs professional)

## Response Handlers

### "How is this different from Signal?"
```
Signal needs phone numbers and app downloads. We're browser-only, no phone numbers, and rooms self-destruct. Plus you can pay with crypto.
```

### "Is it really secure?"
```
End-to-end WebRTC encryption + zero logs + ephemeral rooms. We literally can't access your calls even if we wanted to. Happy to share technical details.
```

### "What's the catch?"
```
No catch. Pay per minute model ($0.05/min). We make money on usage, not your data. Try the free minutes and see.
```

### "Not interested"
```
No worries! If you know anyone who might need private calling, feel free to share. Appreciate you taking a look.
